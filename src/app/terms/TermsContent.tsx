            <h2>Nature of the Platform</h2>
            <p>
              Oxiverse is <strong>Source Available</strong>, and fully
              <strong>Self-Hostable</strong>. We prioritize the decentralization of information tools.
              Our infrastructure is designed to protect user anonymity through zero-logging and zero-persistence — not through network-layer anonymity tools.

            <h2>Acceptable Use & Responsibility</h2>
            <p>
              As a discovery engine, Oxiverse may surface content of all types, including illegal materials
              available on the open web. We strictly expect our users to utilize this platform for
              <strong>Educational and Research Purposes</strong> and other lawful purposes.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>We do not promote, endorse, or host illegal content.</li>
              <li>Users assume full legal responsibility for their interaction with the search results.</li>
              <li>Accessing or searching for prohibited materials is at your own risk and discretion.</li>

            <h2>Network Architecture (Tor-Routing)</h2>
            <p>
              Oxiverse utilizes <strong>Tor-routing</strong> on the <strong>server side</strong> for its
              meta-search backend functionalities. Outbound queries to federated data sources are routed
              through the Tor network to prevent backend IP exhaustion, reduce rate-limiting from upstream
              providers, and maintain consistent access to a broad range of sources.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Tor-routing operates exclusively at the <strong>infrastructure layer</strong> — between our servers and upstream data sources.</li>
              <li>It is <strong>not</strong> a VPN or anonymity layer for your connection to Oxiverse.</li>
              <li>Your traffic between your device and Oxiverse is handled under our standard privacy protocol (see Privacy Policy).</li>
              <li>We do not operate Tor exit nodes, hidden services (.onion), or relay infrastructure on behalf of users.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="border-2 border-primary-700 p-4 bg-primary-900/30 text-sm italic">
              In plain terms: Tor is used so our backend can query the web without getting blocked — not to anonymize you.
              Your anonymity is protected through our zero-logging and zero-persistence architecture, not through Tor.

            <h2>Infrastructure Limits</h2>
            <p>
              To ensure high availability and stability for every participant, we enforce <strong>Rate Limits</strong>.
              Automated traversal or excessive requests that threaten the ecosystem stability may result in
              temporary or permanent access restrictions.
